First Citizen:Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.All:Speak, speak.First Citizen:You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?All:Resolved. resolved.First Citizen:First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.All:We know't, we know't.First Citizen:Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.Is't a verdict?All:No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!Second Citizen:One word, good citizens.First Citizen:We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if theywould yield us but the superfluity, while it werewholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;but they think we are too dear: the leanness thatafflicts us, the object of our misery, is as aninventory to particularise their abundance; oursufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this withour pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know Ispeak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.Second Citizen:Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?All:Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.Second Citizen:Consider you what services he has done for his country?First Citizen:Very well; and could be content to give him goodreport fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.Second Citizen:Nay, but speak not maliciously.First Citizen:I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he didit to that end: though soft-conscienced men can becontent to say it was for his country he did it toplease his mother and to be partly proud; which heis, even till the altitude of his virtue.Second Citizen:What he cannot help in his nature, you account avice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.First Citizen:If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.What shouts are these? The other side o' the cityis risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!All:Come, come.First Citizen:Soft! who comes here?Second Citizen:Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lovedthe people.First Citizen:He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!MENENIUS:What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go youWith bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.First Citizen:Our business is not unknown to the senate; they havehad inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poorsuitors have strong breaths: they shall know wehave strong arms too.MENENIUS:Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,Will you undo yourselves?First Citizen:We cannot, sir, we are undone already.MENENIUS:I tell you, friends, most charitable careHave the patricians of you. For your wants,Your suffering in this dearth, you may as wellStrike at the heaven with your staves as lift themAgainst the Roman state, whose course will onThe way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbsOf more strong link asunder than can everAppear in your impediment. For the dearth,The gods, not the patricians, make it, andYour knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,You are transported by calamityThither where more attends you, and you slanderThe helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,When you curse them as enemies.First Citizen:Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for usyet: suffer us to famish, and their store-housescrammed with grain; make edicts for usury, tosupport usurers; repeal daily any wholesome actestablished against the rich, and provide morepiercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrainthe poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; andthere's all the love they bear us.MENENIUS:Either you mustConfess yourselves wondrous malicious,Or be accused of folly. I shall tell youA pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;But, since it serves my purpose, I will ventureTo stale 't a little more.First Citizen:Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think tofob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't pleaseyou, deliver.MENENIUS:There was a time when all the body's membersRebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:That only like a gulf it did remainI' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,Still cupboarding the viand, never bearingLike labour with the rest, where the other instrumentsDid see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,And, mutually participate, did ministerUnto the appetite and affection commonOf the whole body. The belly answer'd--First Citizen:Well, sir, what answer made the belly?MENENIUS:Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--For, look you, I may make the belly smileAs well as speak--it tauntingly repliedTo the discontented members, the mutinous partsThat envied his receipt; even so most fitlyAs you malign our senators for thatThey are not such as you.First Citizen:Your belly's answer? What!The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.With other muniments and petty helpsIn this our fabric, if that they--MENENIUS:What then?'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?First Citizen:Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,Who is the sink o' the body,--MENENIUS:Well, what then?First Citizen:The former agents, if they did complain,What could the belly answer?MENENIUS:I will tell youIf you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.First Citizen:Ye're long about it.MENENIUS:Note me this, good friend;Your most grave belly was deliberate,Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,'That I receive the general food at first,Which you do live upon; and fit it is,Because I am the store-house and the shopOf the whole body: but, if you do remember,I send it through the rivers of your blood,Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;And, through the cranks and offices of man,The strongest nerves and small inferior veinsFrom me receive that natural competencyWhereby they live: and though that all at once,You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--First Citizen:Ay, sir; well, well.MENENIUS:'Though all at once cannotSee what I do deliver out to each,Yet I can make my audit up, that allFrom me do back receive the flour of all,And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?First Citizen:It was an answer: how apply you this?MENENIUS:The senators of Rome are this good belly,And you the mutinous members; for examineTheir counsels and their cares, digest things rightlyTouching the weal o' the common, you shall findNo public benefit which you receiveBut it proceeds or comes from them to youAnd no way from yourselves. What do you think,You, the great toe of this assembly?First Citizen:I the great toe! why the great toe?MENENIUS:For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,Lead'st first to win some vantage.But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;The one side must have bale.Hail, noble Marcius!MARCIUS:Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,Make yourselves scabs?First Citizen:We have ever your good word.MARCIUS:He that will give good words to thee will flatterBeneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue isTo make him worthy whose offence subdues himAnd curse that justice did it.Who deserves greatnessDeserves your hate; and your affections areA sick man's appetite, who desires most thatWhich would increase his evil. He that dependsUpon your favours swims with fins of leadAnd hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?With every minute you do change a mind,And call him noble that was now your hate,Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,That in these several places of the cityYou cry against the noble senate, who,Under the gods, keep you in awe, which elseWould feed on one another? What's their seeking?MENENIUS:For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,The city is well stored.MARCIUS:Hang 'em! They say!They'll sit by the fire, and presume to knowWhat's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,Who thrives and who declines; side factionsand give outConjectural marriages; making parties strongAnd feebling such as stand not in their likingBelow their cobbled shoes. They say there'sgrain enough!Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarryWith thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as highAs I could pick my lance.MENENIUS:Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;For though abundantly they lack discretion,Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,What says the other troop?MARCIUS:They are dissolved: hang 'em!They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent notCorn for the rich men only: with these shredsThey vented their complainings; which being answer'd,And a petition granted them, a strange one--To break the heart of generosity,And make bold power look pale--they threw their capsAs they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,Shouting their emulation.MENENIUS:What is granted them?MARCIUS:Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in timeWin upon power and throw forth greater themesFor insurrection's arguing.MENENIUS:This is strange.MARCIUS:Go, get you home, you fragments!Messenger:Where's Caius Marcius?MARCIUS:Here: what's the matter?Messenger:The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.MARCIUS:I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to ventOur musty superfluity. See, our best elders.First Senator:Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;The Volsces are in arms.MARCIUS:They have a leader,Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.I sin in envying his nobility,And were I any thing but what I am,I would wish me only he.COMINIUS:You have fought together.MARCIUS:Were half to half the world by the ears and he.Upon my party, I'ld revolt to makeOnly my wars with him: he is a lionThat I am proud to hunt.First Senator:Then, worthy Marcius,Attend upon Cominius to these wars.COMINIUS:It is your former promise.MARCIUS:Sir, it is;And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thouShalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?TITUS:No, Caius Marcius;I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,Ere stay behind this business.MENENIUS:O, true-bred!First Senator:Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,Our greatest friends attend us.TITUS:COMINIUS:Noble Marcius!First Senator:MARCIUS:Nay, let them follow:The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thitherTo gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.SICINIUS:Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?BRUTUS:He has no equal.SICINIUS:When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--BRUTUS:Mark'd you his lip and eyes?SICINIUS:Nay. but his taunts.BRUTUS:Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.SICINIUS:Be-mock the modest moon.BRUTUS:The present wars devour him: he is grownToo proud to be so valiant.SICINIUS:Such a nature,Tickled with good success, disdains the shadowWhich he treads on at noon: but I do wonderHis insolence can brook to be commandedUnder Cominius.BRUTUS:Fame, at the which he aims,In whom already he's well graced, can notBetter be held nor more attain'd than byA place below the first: for what miscarriesShall be the general's fault, though he performTo the utmost of a man, and giddy censureWill then cry out of Marcius 'O if heHad borne the business!'SICINIUS:Besides, if things go well,Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shallOf his demerits rob Cominius.BRUTUS:Come:Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faultsTo Marcius shall be honours, though indeedIn aught he merit not.SICINIUS:Let's hence, and hearHow the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,More than his singularity, he goesUpon this present action.BRUTUS:Lets along.First Senator:So, your opinion is, Aufidius,That they of Rome are entered in our counselsAnd know how we proceed.AUFIDIUS:Is it not yours?What ever have been thought on in this state,That could be brought to bodily act ere RomeHad circumvention? 'Tis not four days goneSince I heard thence; these are the words: I thinkI have the letter here; yes, here it is.'They have press'd a power, but it is not knownWhether for east or west: the dearth is great;The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,These three lead on this preparationWhither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:Consider of it.'First Senator:Our army's in the fieldWe never yet made doubt but Rome was readyTo answer us.AUFIDIUS:Nor did you think it follyTo keep your great pretences veil'd till whenThey needs must show themselves; whichin the hatching,It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which wasTo take in many towns ere almost RomeShould know we were afoot.Second Senator:Noble Aufidius,Take your commission; hie you to your bands:Let us alone to guard Corioli:If they set down before 's, for the removeBring your army; but, I think, you'll findThey've not prepared for us.AUFIDIUS:O, doubt not that;I speak from certainties. Nay, more,Some parcels of their power are forth already,And only hitherward. I leave your honours.If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strikeTill one can do no more.All:The gods assist you!AUFIDIUS:And keep your honours safe!First Senator:Farewell.Second Senator:Farewell.All:Farewell.VOLUMNIA:I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in amore comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, Ishould freelier rejoice in that absence wherein hewon honour than in the embracements of his bed wherehe would show most love. When yet he was buttender-bodied and the only son of my womb, whenyouth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, whenfor a day of kings' entreaties a mother should notsell him an hour from her beholding, I, consideringhow honour would become such a person. that it wasno better than picture-like to hang by the wall, ifrenown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seekdanger where he was like to find fame. To a cruelwar I sent him; from whence he returned, his browsbound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang notmore in joy at first hearing he was a man-childthan now in first seeing he had proved himself aman.VIRGILIA:But had he died in the business, madam; how then?VOLUMNIA:Then his good report should have been my son; Itherein would have found issue. Hear me professsincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my lovealike and none less dear than thine and my goodMarcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for theircountry than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.Gentlewoman:Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.VIRGILIA:Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.VOLUMNIA:Indeed, you shall not.Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody browWith his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mowOr all or lose his hire.VIRGILIA:His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!VOLUMNIA:Away, you fool! it more becomes a manThan gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelierThan Hector's forehead when it spit forth bloodAt Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,We are fit to bid her welcome.VIRGILIA:Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!VOLUMNIA:He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his kneeAnd tread upon his neck.VALERIA:My ladies both, good day to you.VOLUMNIA:Sweet madam.VIRGILIA:I am glad to see your ladyship.VALERIA:How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in goodfaith. How does your little son?VIRGILIA:I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.VOLUMNIA:He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, thanlook upon his school-master.VALERIA:O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis avery pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'Wednesday half an hour together: has such aconfirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gildedbutterfly: and when he caught it, he let it goagain; and after it again; and over and over hecomes, and again; catched it again; or whether hisfall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set histeeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammockedit!VOLUMNIA:One on 's father's moods.VALERIA:Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.VIRGILIA:A crack, madam.VALERIA:Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you playthe idle husewife with me this afternoon.VIRGILIA:No, good madam; I will not out of doors.VALERIA:Not out of doors!VOLUMNIA:She shall, she shall.VIRGILIA:Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over thethreshold till my lord return from the wars.VALERIA:Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,you must go visit the good lady that lies in.VIRGILIA:I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her withmy prayers; but I cannot go thither.VOLUMNIA:Why, I pray you?VIRGILIA:'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.VALERIA:You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, allthe yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fillIthaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambricwere sensible as your finger, that you might leavepricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.VIRGILIA:No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.VALERIA:In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell youexcellent news of your husband.VIRGILIA:O, good madam, there can be none yet.VALERIA:Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news fromhim last night.VIRGILIA:Indeed, madam?VALERIA:In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; againstwhom Cominius the general is gone, with one part ofour Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are setdown before their city Corioli; they nothing doubtprevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.VIRGILIA:Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything hereafter.VOLUMNIA:Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will butdisease our better mirth.VALERIA:In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thysolemness out o' door. and go along with us.VIRGILIA:No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wishyou much mirth.VALERIA:Well, then, farewell.MARCIUS:Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.LARTIUS:My horse to yours, no.MARCIUS:'Tis done.LARTIUS:Agreed.MARCIUS:Say, has our general met the enemy?Messenger:They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.LARTIUS:So, the good horse is mine.MARCIUS:I'll buy him of you.LARTIUS:No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I willFor half a hundred years. Summon the town.MARCIUS:How far off lie these armies?Messenger:Within this mile and half.MARCIUS:Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,That we with smoking swords may march from hence,To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?First Senator:No, nor a man that fears you less than he,That's lesser than a little.Hark! our drumsAre bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;They'll open of themselves.Hark you. far off!There is Aufidius; list, what work he makesAmongst your cloven army.MARCIUS:O, they are at it!LARTIUS:Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!MARCIUS:They fear us not, but issue forth their city.Now put your shields before your hearts, and fightWith hearts more proof than shields. Advance,brave Titus:They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,And he shall feel mine edge.MARCIUS:All the contagion of the south light on you,You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plaguesPlaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'dFurther than seen and one infect anotherAgainst the wind a mile! You souls of geese,That bear the shapes of men, how have you runFrom slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!All hurt behind; backs red, and faces paleWith flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foeAnd make my wars on you: look to't: come on;If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,As they us to our trenches followed.So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.First Soldier:Fool-hardiness; not I.Second Soldier:Nor I.First Soldier:See, they have shut him in.All:To the pot, I warrant him.LARTIUS:What is become of Marcius?All:Slain, sir, doubtless.First Soldier:Following the fliers at the very heels,With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,To answer all the city.LARTIUS:O noble fellow!Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldierEven to Cato's wish, not fierce and terribleOnly in strokes; but, with thy grim looks andThe thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the worldWere feverous and did tremble.First Soldier:Look, sir.LARTIUS:O,'tis Marcius!Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.First Roman:This will I carry to Rome.Second Roman:And I this.Third Roman:A murrain on't! I took this for silver.MARCIUS:See here these movers that do prize their hoursAt a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen wouldBury with those that wore them, these base slaves,Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, takeConvenient numbers to make good the city;Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will hasteTo help Cominius.LARTIUS:Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;Thy exercise hath been too violent forA second course of fight.MARCIUS:Sir, praise me not;My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:The blood I drop is rather physicalThan dangerous to me: to Aufidius thusI will appear, and fight.LARTIUS:Now the fair goddess, Fortune,Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charmsMisguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,Prosperity be thy page!MARCIUS:Thy friend no lessThan those she placeth highest! So, farewell.LARTIUS:Thou worthiest Marcius!Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;Call thither all the officers o' the town,Where they shall know our mind: away!COMINIUS:Breathe you, my friends: well fought;we are come offLike Romans, neither foolish in our stands,Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,By interims and conveying gusts we have heardThe charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!Lead their successes as we wish our own,That both our powers, with smilingfronts encountering,May give you thankful sacrifice.Thy news?Messenger:The citizens of Corioli have issued,And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:I saw our party to their trenches driven,And then I came away.COMINIUS:Though thou speak'st truth,Methinks thou speak'st not well.How long is't since?Messenger:Above an hour, my lord.COMINIUS:'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,And bring thy news so late?Messenger:Spies of the VolscesHeld me in chase, that I was forced to wheelThree or four miles about, else had I, sir,Half an hour since brought my report.COMINIUS:Who's yonder,That does appear as he were flay'd? O godsHe has the stamp of Marcius; and I haveBefore-time seen him thus.MARCIUS:COMINIUS:The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabourMore than I know the sound of Marcius' tongueFrom every meaner man.MARCIUS:Come I too late?COMINIUS:Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,But mantled in your own.MARCIUS:O, let me clip yeIn arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heartAs merry as when our nuptial day was done,And tapers burn'd to bedward!COMINIUS:Flower of warriors,How is it with Titus Lartius?MARCIUS:As with a man busied about decrees:Condemning some to death, and some to exile;Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,To let him slip at will.COMINIUS:Where is that slaveWhich told me they had beat you to your trenches?Where is he? call him hither.MARCIUS:Let him alone;He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budgeFrom rascals worse than they.COMINIUS:But how prevail'd you?MARCIUS:Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?If not, why cease you till you are so?COMINIUS:Marcius,We have at disadvantage fought and didRetire to win our purpose.MARCIUS:How lies their battle? know you on which sideThey have placed their men of trust?COMINIUS:As I guess, Marcius,Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,Their very heart of hope.MARCIUS:I do beseech you,By all the battles wherein we have fought,By the blood we have shed together, by the vowsWe have made to endure friends, that you directlySet me against Aufidius and his Antiates;And that you not delay the present, but,Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,We prove this very hour.COMINIUS:Though I could wishYou were conducted to a gentle bathAnd balms applied to, you, yet dare I neverDeny your asking: take your choice of thoseThat best can aid your action.MARCIUS:Those are theyThat most are willing. If any such be here--As it were sin to doubt--that love this paintingWherein you see me smear'd; if any fearLesser his person than an ill report;If any think brave death outweighs bad lifeAnd that his country's dearer than himself;Let him alone, or so many so minded,Wave thus, to express his disposition,And follow Marcius.O, me alone! make you a sword of me?If these shows be not outward, which of youBut is four Volsces? none of you but isAble to bear against the great AufidiusA shield as hard as his. A certain number,Though thanks to all, must I selectfrom all: the restShall bear the business in some other fight,As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;And four shall quickly draw out my command,Which men are best inclined.COMINIUS:March on, my fellows:Make good this ostentation, and you shallDivide in all with us.LARTIUS:So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatchThose centuries to our aid: the rest will serveFor a short holding: if we lose the field,We cannot keep the town.Lieutenant:Fear not our care, sir.LARTIUS:Hence, and shut your gates upon's.Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.MARCIUS:I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate theeWorse than a promise-breaker.AUFIDIUS:We hate alike:Not Afric owns a serpent I abhorMore than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.MARCIUS:Let the first budger die the other's slave,And the gods doom him after!AUFIDIUS:If I fly, Marcius,Holloa me like a hare.MARCIUS:Within these three hours, Tullus,Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my bloodWherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revengeWrench up thy power to the highest.AUFIDIUS:Wert thou the HectorThat was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,Thou shouldst not scape me here.Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed meIn your condemned seconds.COMINIUS:If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report itWhere senators shall mingle tears with smiles,Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,And, gladly quaked, hear more; where thedull tribunes,That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the godsOur Rome hath such a soldier.'Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,Having fully dined before.LARTIUS:O general,Here is the steed, we the caparison:Hadst thou beheld--MARCIUS:Pray now, no more: my mother,Who has a charter to extol her blood,When she does praise me grieves me. I have doneAs you have done; that's what I can; inducedAs you have been; that's for my country:He that has but effected his good willHath overta'en mine act.COMINIUS:You shall not beThe grave of your deserving; Rome must knowThe value of her own: 'twere a concealmentWorse than a theft, no less than a traducement,To hide your doings; and to silence that,Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech youIn sign of what you are, not to rewardWhat you have done--before our army hear me.MARCIUS:I have some wounds upon me, and they smartTo hear themselves remember'd.COMINIUS:Should they not,Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of allThe treasure in this field achieved and city,We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,Before the common distribution, atYour only choice.MARCIUS:I thank you, general;But cannot make my heart consent to takeA bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;And stand upon my common part with thoseThat have beheld the doing.MARCIUS:May these same instruments, which you profane,Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shallI' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities beMade all of false-faced soothing!When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,Let him be made a coverture for the wars!No more, I say! For that I have not wash'dMy nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--Which, without note, here's many else have done,--You shout me forthIn acclamations hyperbolical;As if I loved my little should be dietedIn praises sauced with lies.COMINIUS:Too modest are you;More cruel to your good report than gratefulTo us that give you truly: by your patience,If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,As to us, to all the world, that Caius MarciusWears this war's garland: in token of the which,My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,With all his trim belonging; and from this time,For what he did before Corioli, call him,With all the applause and clamour of the host,CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! BearThe addition nobly ever!All:Caius Marcius Coriolanus!CORIOLANUS:I will go wash;And when my face is fair, you shall perceiveWhether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.I mean to stride your steed, and at all timesTo undercrest your good additionTo the fairness of my power.COMINIUS:So, to our tent;Where, ere we do repose us, we will writeTo Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,Must to Corioli back: send us to RomeThe best, with whom we may articulate,For their own good and ours.LARTIUS:I shall, my lord.CORIOLANUS:The gods begin to mock me. I, that nowRefused most princely gifts, am bound to begOf my lord general.COMINIUS:Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?CORIOLANUS:I sometime lay here in CorioliAt a poor man's house; he used me kindly:He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;But then Aufidius was within my view,And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request youTo give my poor host freedom.COMINIUS:O, well begg'd!Were he the butcher of my son, he shouldBe free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.LARTIUS:Marcius, his name?CORIOLANUS:By Jupiter! forgot.I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.Have we no wine here?COMINIUS:Go we to our tent:The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis timeIt should be look'd to: come.AUFIDIUS:The town is ta'en!First Soldier:'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.AUFIDIUS:Condition!I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!What good condition can a treaty findI' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounterAs often as we eat. By the elements,If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,He's mine, or I am his: mine emulationHath not that honour in't it had; for whereI thought to crush him in an equal force,True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some wayOr wrath or craft may get him.First Soldier:He's the devil.AUFIDIUS:Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'dWith only suffering stain by him; for himShall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,Embarquements all of fury, shall lift upTheir rotten privilege and custom 'gainstMy hate to Marcius: where I find him, were itAt home, upon my brother's guard, even there,Against the hospitable canon, would IWash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that mustBe hostages for Rome.First Soldier:Will not you go?AUFIDIUS:I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thitherHow the world goes, that to the pace of itI may spur on my journey.First Soldier:I shall, sir.MENENIUS:The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.BRUTUS:Good or bad?MENENIUS:Not according to the prayer of the people, for theylove not Marcius.SICINIUS:Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.MENENIUS:Pray you, who does the wolf love?SICINIUS:The lamb.MENENIUS:Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would thenoble Marcius.BRUTUS:He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.MENENIUS:He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You twoare old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.Both:Well, sir.MENENIUS:In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you twohave not in abundance?BRUTUS:He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.SICINIUS:Especially in pride.BRUTUS:And topping all others in boasting.MENENIUS:This is strange now: do you two know how you arecensured here in the city, I mean of us o' theright-hand file? do you?Both:Why, how are we censured?MENENIUS:Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?Both:Well, well, sir, well.MENENIUS:Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief ofoccasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:give your dispositions the reins, and be angry atyour pleasures; at the least if you take it as apleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius forbeing proud?BRUTUS:We do it not alone, sir.MENENIUS:I know you can do very little alone; for your helpsare many, or else your actions would grow wondroussingle: your abilities are too infant-like fordoing much alone. You talk of pride: O that youcould turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,and make but an interior survey of your good selves!O that you could!BRUTUS:What then, sir?MENENIUS:Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, asany in Rome.SICINIUS:Menenius, you are known well enough too.MENENIUS:I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one thatloves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allayingTiber in't; said to be something imperfect infavouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-likeupon too trivial motion; one that converses morewith the buttock of the night than with the foreheadof the morning: what I think I utter, and spend mymalice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen asyou are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drinkyou give me touch my palate adversely, I make acrooked face at it. I can't say your worships havedelivered the matter well, when I find the ass incompound with the major part of your syllables: andthough I must be content to bear with those that sayyou are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly thattell you you have good faces. If you see this inthe map of my microcosm, follows it that I am knownwell enough too? what barm can your bissonconspectuities glean out of this character, if I beknown well enough too?BRUTUS:Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.MENENIUS:You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. Youare ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: youwear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing acause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to asecond day of audience. When you are hearing amatter between party and party, if you chance to bepinched with the colic, you make faces likemummers; set up the bloody flag against allpatience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangledby your hearing: all the peace you make in theircause is, calling both the parties knaves. You area pair of strange ones.BRUTUS:Come, come, you are well understood to be aperfecter giber for the table than a necessarybencher in the Capitol.MENENIUS:Our very priests must become mockers, if they shallencounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. Whenyou speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth thewagging of your beards; and your beards deserve notso honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher'scushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessorssince Deucalion, though peradventure some of thebest of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den toyour worships: more of your conversation wouldinfect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastlyplebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you followyour eyes so fast?VOLUMNIA:Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; forthe love of Juno, let's go.MENENIUS:Ha! Marcius coming home!VOLUMNIA:Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperousapprobation.MENENIUS:Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!Marcius coming home!VOLUMNIA:Nay,'tis true.VOLUMNIA:Look, here's a letter from him: the state hathanother, his wife another; and, I think, there's oneat home for you.MENENIUS:I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter forme!VIRGILIA:Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.MENENIUS:A letter for me! it gives me an estate of sevenyears' health; in which time I will make a lip atthe physician: the most sovereign prescription inGalen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,of no better report than a horse-drench. Is henot wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.VIRGILIA:O, no, no, no.VOLUMNIA:O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.MENENIUS:So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.VOLUMNIA:On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time homewith the oaken garland.MENENIUS:Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?VOLUMNIA:Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, butAufidius got off.MENENIUS:And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:an he had stayed by him, I would not have been sofidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the goldthat's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?VOLUMNIA:Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senatehas letters from the general, wherein he gives myson the whole name of the war: he hath in thisaction outdone his former deeds doublyVALERIA:In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.MENENIUS:Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without histrue purchasing.VIRGILIA:The gods grant them true!VOLUMNIA:True! pow, wow.MENENIUS:True! I'll be sworn they are true.Where is he wounded?God save your good worships! Marcius is cominghome: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?VOLUMNIA:I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will belarge cicatrices to show the people, when he shallstand for his place. He received in the repulse ofTarquin seven hurts i' the body.MENENIUS:One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there'snine that I know.VOLUMNIA:He had, before this last expedition, twenty-fivewounds upon him.MENENIUS:Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.Hark! the trumpets.VOLUMNIA:These are the ushers of Marcius: before him hecarries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.Herald:Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fightWithin Corioli gates: where he hath won,With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; theseIn honour follows Coriolanus.Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!All:Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!CORIOLANUS:No more of this; it does offend my heart:Pray now, no more.COMINIUS:Look, sir, your mother!CORIOLANUS:O,You have, I know, petition'd all the godsFor my prosperity!VOLUMNIA:Nay, my good soldier, up;My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, andBy deed-achieving honour newly named,--What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--But O, thy wife!CORIOLANUS:My gracious silence, hail!Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,And mothers that lack sons.MENENIUS:Now, the gods crown thee!CORIOLANUS:And live you yet?O my sweet lady, pardon.VOLUMNIA:I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.MENENIUS:A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weepAnd I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.A curse begin at very root on's heart,That is not glad to see thee! You are threeThat Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,We have some old crab-trees hereat home that will notBe grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:We call a nettle but a nettle andThe faults of fools but folly.COMINIUS:Ever right.CORIOLANUS:Menenius ever, ever.Herald:Give way there, and go on!CORIOLANUS:VOLUMNIA:I have livedTo see inherited my very wishesAnd the buildings of my fancy: onlyThere's one thing wanting, which I doubt not butOur Rome will cast upon thee.CORIOLANUS:Know, good mother,I had rather be their servant in my way,Than sway with them in theirs.COMINIUS:On, to the Capitol!BRUTUS:All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sightsAre spectacled to see him: your prattling nurseInto a rapture lets her baby cryWhile she chats him: the kitchen malkin pinsHer richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsedWith variable complexions, all agreeingIn earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamensDo press among the popular throngs and puffTo win a vulgar station: or veil'd damesCommit the war of white and damask inTheir nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoilOf Phoebus' burning kisses: such a potherAs if that whatsoever god who leads himWere slily crept into his human powersAnd gave him graceful posture.SICINIUS:On the sudden,I warrant him consul.BRUTUS:Then our office may,During his power, go sleep.SICINIUS:He cannot temperately transport his honoursFrom where he should begin and end, but willLose those he hath won.BRUTUS:In that there's comfort.SICINIUS:Doubt notThe commoners, for whom we stand, but theyUpon their ancient malice will forgetWith the least cause these his new honours, whichThat he will give them make I as little questionAs he is proud to do't.BRUTUS:I heard him swear,Were he to stand for consul, never would heAppear i' the market-place nor on him putThe napless vesture of humility;Nor showing, as the manner is, his woundsTo the people, beg their stinking breaths.
